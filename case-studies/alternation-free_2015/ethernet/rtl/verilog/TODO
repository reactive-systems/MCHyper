// In loopback rx_clk is not looped back. Possible CRC error. Consider if usage
// of additional logic is necessery (FIFO for looping the data).

// HASH improvement needed.
//


- Add logic for easier use of the HASH table: First write MAC address to some
  register. Then issue a command. CRC is calculated from this MAC and appropriate
  bit written to the HASH register.
  
- In loopback rx_clk is not looped back. Possible CRC error. Consider if usage of
  additional logic is necessery (FIFO for looping the data).

- When sending frames bigger than MaxFL, MaxFL is sent, BD marked as finished, 
  TxB_IRQ interrupt is set and MTxErr is set for a short period. Fix MTxErr or 
  prevent sending too big frames or set TxE_IRQ instead.
